          "behavior that does not fit into their set of principles, they will ruthlessly judge it and shut down any",
          "solve problems in an effective way. Perhaps most importantly, the ESTJ loses the ability to connect with",
          "their own Self. They become out of touch with their own personal needs, and dissociated from their core",
          "self. The net effect of these happenings is an ESTJ leader who expects absolute adherence to his or her",

          "the importance of the auxiliary Sensing function is reduced. Data cannot be seen outside of its context",
